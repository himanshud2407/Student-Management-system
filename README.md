# 🎓 Student Management System (C++)

## 📘 Project Overview
The **Student Management System** is a simple console-based C++ application that helps manage basic student information.  
It allows users to **add new student records** and **display all existing records** stored in a text file.  
This project demonstrates the use of **classes, objects, file handling, and menu-driven programming** in C++.

## 🧠 Concepts Used
- Classes and Objects  
- File Handling (`ifstream`, `ofstream`)  
- Basic Input/Output  
- Menu-driven program using loops and switch statements
